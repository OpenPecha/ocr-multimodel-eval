# Output CER Scores

This folder contains the output of the CER evaluation process. The CER scores are calculated by comparing the ground truth text files in the `ground_truth` folder with the text files in the `script_inferenced/script_inferenced_txt` folder generated by the script.

## Script Configuration

`script_inferenced/script_inferenced_txt` contains the output of the script inference run using the following prompt:

```
prompt = """
Extract only the Tibetan text from this image. Return ONLY the raw Tibetan
characters exactly as they appear in the image, with no English explanations,
no formatting, no line numbers, no headers, and no additional commentary. Just
the pure Tibetan text.
"""
```

## File Format

The CER scores are stored in a CSV file, where each row represents a single image and the columns represent the following information:

- `Image`: The image number
- `CER`: The Character Error Rate (CER) score for the image
- `Ground_Truth`: The ground truth text for the image
- `Inferenced`: The text generated by the script for the image

The combined CER score for all images is also stored in the CSV file, in the last row.
