# Output CER Scores

This folder contains the output of the CER evaluation process. The CER scores are calculated by comparing the ground truth text files in the `ground_truth` folder with the text files in the `inferenced` folder.

## File Format

The CER scores are stored in a CSV file, where each row represents a single image and the columns represent the following information:

- `Image`: The image number
- `CER`: The Character Error Rate (CER) score for the image
- `Ground_Truth`: The ground truth text for the image
- `Inferenced`: The text generated by the model for the image

The combined CER score for all images is also stored in the CSV file, in the last row.
