# Script Inferenced

This directory contains the OCR inference results generated by automated scripts using API calls with a specific prompt focused on extracting raw Tibetan text.

The `script_inferenced_txt` directory contains the combined txt files of the inference results.

## Script Configuration

The inference was run using the following prompt:

```
prompt = """
Extract only the Tibetan text from this image. Return ONLY the raw Tibetan
characters exactly as they appear in the image, with no English explanations,
no formatting, no line numbers, no headers, and no additional commentary. Just
the pure Tibetan text.
"""
```
