# Data Directory

This directory contains all data files used for OCR multi-model evaluation, including input images, ground truth data, and inference results.

## Directory Structure

### `images/`

Contains the original image files used for OCR evaluation. These are the source images that will be processed by different OCR models.

### `ground_truth/`

Contains the manually verified, correct text transcriptions for the images. These serve as the reference standard against which OCR model outputs are compared for accuracy evaluation.

### `inferenced/`

Stores the OCR output results from different models. Each model's predictions are saved here for comparison and evaluation. This is manual inference results by using WebSite.

### `script_inferenced/` & `script_inferenced_2/`

Contains OCR inference results generated by automated scripts using API calls. These directories likely represent different runs or versions of the inference process.

### `bar_chart/`

Contains visualization files (charts/graphs) generated from the evaluation results, providing visual comparisons of model performance. (Only for the manual inference results)

## Usage

1. **Input**: Place your test images in the `images/` directory
2. **Reference**: Ensure corresponding ground truth text files are in `ground_truth/`
3. **Processing**: OCR models will generate outputs stored in `inferenced/` and `script_inferenced/` directories
4. **Analysis**: Results are visualized and saved in `bar_chart/`

## File Formats

- Images: Typically PNG, JPG, or other common image formats
- Ground truth: Text files (.txt) with correct transcriptions
- Inference results: CSV or text files containing OCR outputs
- Visualizations: PNG/SVG chart files
