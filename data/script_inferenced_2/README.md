# Script Inferenced 2

This directory contains the OCR inference results generated by automated scripts using API calls with specific prompt configurations.

## Script Configuration

The inference was run using the following prompt:

```
prompt = """ You are an absolute expert on Tibetan. Please OCR and extract all the main text from this file, be as accurate as possible. Make use of your specific knowledge of Tibetan to ensure accuracy. Don't use markdown in the output. """
```

## Model Settings

For the `pro` models, the `thinking_budget` was set to 128 (lowest possible), while other models used 0:

```python
thinking_budget = 128 if 'pro' in model_name.lower() else 0
```
